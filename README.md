# Physical-Design-Using-OpenLANE-SKY130
This repository contains all the information studied and created during the Advanced Physical Design Using OpenLANE / SKY130 workshop. It is primarily foucused on a complete RTL2GDS flow using the open-soucre flow named OpenLANE. PICORV32A RISC-V core design is used for the purpose.
